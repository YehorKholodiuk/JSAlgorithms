// --- Directions
// these questions are the same:
// Given a string, return the character that is most
// commonly used in the string.
// What is the most common character in a string?
// Does the given string have any repeated characters in it?

// this question is not quite the same but uses similar logic:
// Does string A have the same characters as string B (is it an anagram)?

// --- Examples
// maxChar("aabcccccccd") === "c"
// maxChar("apple 1231111") === "1"
